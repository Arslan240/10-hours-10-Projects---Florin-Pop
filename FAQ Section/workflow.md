
# How i'll build the logic for changing the color of sidebar icons on click.

i- First i'll show the basic page and store the first icon which will be set to changed background.

ii- The previously clicked icon will be stored in a variable so that, i can change it's background back to normal when clicked on other icon.
  
# After implementing the functionality of sidebar icons to change colors, their hover styles get overwritten after first pass from all of them. IDK why.

# Show questions of each section after clicking on them.

i- I will create 5 arrays containing questions, when relevant icon is clicked all the questions will be loaded by creating a new question div for each question
